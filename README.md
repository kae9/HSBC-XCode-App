This project was created during a hackathon at HSBC, where I proposed and prototyped a company wide social netowrking app
designed to break communication barriers across global teams. The concept focused on enabling employees from different
regions to collaborate, share updates, and build a community. This would have been supported by real-time translation and
localised UI text.

This app was a prototype to demonstrate how HSBC employees could interact seamlessly. The app was built using Swift and
Xcode with a clean, simple interface, showing posts automatically translated into multiple languages. This helped 
communicate the vision for a scalable, enterprise-safe internal social network.
